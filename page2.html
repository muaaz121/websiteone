            <h2>Dengue Outbreak 2024: October Deadliest Month So Far</h2>
            <p>Despite seven days still remaining before the end of the month, October has already become the deadliest month this year in terms of deaths and cases from dengue. With seven more deaths reported in the 24 hours till yesterday morning, the total death toll this year has now risen to 264. Of the deaths, 108 were recorded in the first 23 days of October. Dengue claimed 80 lives in September, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Out of a total of 53,196 cases this year, over 20,000 people were infected in this month alone, the data show. Experts have attributed the surge in dengue fatalities this year to the nationwide lack of mosquito control measures by the relevant authorities. Besides, late hospitalisation, multiple infections, and false detection are also blamed for the rise.</p>
