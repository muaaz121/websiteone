                <li>Your sensitivity to certain allergens may be connected to your birth weight. A 2019 meta-analysis found that for each kilogram increase in birth weight, infants had a 44% increased risk of childhood food allergies.</li>
                <li>In the US, two out of three people do not have perfect vision (20/20). Age-related eye diseases are among the leading causes of blindness and low vision.</li>
                <li>More germs are transferred by shaking hands than by kissing. Our hands come into contact with millions of germs and bacteria each day.</li>
                <li>Lack of sleep can kill someone sooner than starvation. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, obesity, and a host of other life-threatening conditions.</li>
                <li>Stress can make it harder to fall asleep. The relationship between stress and sleep is clear: When you’re stressed, your body releases cortisol, which initiates your body’s “fight or flight” response and keeps you alert.</li>
